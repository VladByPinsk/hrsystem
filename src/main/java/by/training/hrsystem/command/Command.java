 * Interface {@code Command} is implemented by classes that encapsulate the
 * algorithm command on the HTTP-request processing. Team - an intermediate
 * layer between the controller (getting the client's request) and service
 * (application logic). This command is used to process the request parameters
 * and transfer their service in the correct data format. As a result of its
 * implementation, the team must set the appropriate attributes in the request
 * context / session for the purpose of informing the client about the result of
 * its request (whether the request was successful or an error occurs as a
 * result ended). Also the team on the basis of the parameters / attributes
 * request / session, and on the basis of the results of the service makes the
 * decision on what type of page you want to redirect a request or a command to
 * transfer control for further processing.
